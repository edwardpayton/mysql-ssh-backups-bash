# mysql-ssh-backups-bash
My initial bash backup script that inspired me to make the Python version


Created this script to test the concept before creating the full Python backup.

Quick and dirty commit (the script doesn't include variables, error handling, or a very sophisticated email function), I may build on the script if time allows, but really it's just here for my own record.
